## Transform to json

- use `Find and replace` to transform to json
  - Remove empty lines, replace `\n\n` with `\n`
  - Quote all lines, replace `\n` with `",\n"`
  - Add a `[` and `]`
  - Now we have a json file
- Run a script to transform objects

```javascript
list.map((l) => {
  const parts = l.replace('.', '').split(" - ");
  return {
    name: parts[0].trim(),
    requiredSkills: parts[1].split(", ").map((d) => d.trim()),
  };
});

// we should get
var example = {
  name: "Software Developer",
  requiredSkills: [
    "problem-solving",
    "programming languages",
    "data structures and algorithms",
    "version control",
    "software design",
    "software testing",
    "debugging",
    "critical thinking",
    "communication",
  ],
};
```


## Fix casing

```javascript
function toCapitalCase(str) {
  return str
    .split(/[\s-]+/)
    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
    .join(' ');
}

skills.map(skill => {
  const name = toCapitalCase(skill.name)
  const requiredSkills = skill.requiredSkills.map(toCapitalCase)
  return {
    ...skill,
    name,
    requiredSkills
  }
})
```

## Build the graph of skills (for fun)

```javascript
list.flatMap((i) => i.skills.map((s) => `[${s}] -> [${i.job}]`));
```

- Use [https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw] to generate a graph
  - Looks really bad, but better if exported using SVG

- Build a list of skills only

```javascript
function getUniqueStrings(arr) {
  // create an empty object to store unique strings
  let uniqueStrings = {};

  // iterate through the array
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // add each string as a key in the object
    uniqueStrings[arr[i]] = true;
  }

  // get the keys of the object and return them as an array
  return Object.keys(uniqueStrings);
}

getUniqueStrings(jobs.flatMap(k => k.skills))
```

temp2.map(t => {
  const d = temp1.find(j => j.name === t.name)
  if (!d) {
    console.log('not found', d.name);
    return t
  }
  return {...t, description: d.description}
});
```

# Step 4: ask ChatGPT to rank the skills

> I'll give you a list of skills, I need you to rank them based on the difficulty to acquire them. putting them in 5 categories, from 1 to 5, with increasing difficulty. Do you understand?

# Step 6: break cyclic dependency

Some skills require skills that require it. We need to make the "tier 0" skills that doesn't require anything.

# Step 6: generate price to acquire skills

```javascript
var demands = {}
const required = skills.flatMap(s => s.requiredSkills)

```
