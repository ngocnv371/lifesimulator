# transform to json

- use `Find and replace` to transform to json
  - Remove empty lines, replace `\n\n` with `\n`
  - Quote all lines, replace `\n` with `",\n"`
  - Add a `[` and `]`
  - Now we have a json file
- Run a script to transform objects

```javascript
list.map((l) => {
  const parts = l.replace('.', '').split(" - ");
  return {
    job: parts[0].trim(),
    skills: parts[1].split(", ").map((d) => d.trim()),
  };
});

// we should get
var example = {
  job: "Software Developer",
  skills: [
    "problem-solving",
    "programming languages",
    "data structures and algorithms",
    "version control",
    "software design",
    "software testing",
    "debugging",
    "critical thinking",
    "communication",
  ],
};
```

- Build the graph

```javascript
list.flatMap((i) => i.skills.map((s) => `[${s}] -> [${i.job}]`));
```

- Use [https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw] to generate a graph
  - Looks really bad, but better if exported using SVG

- Build a list of skills only

```javascript
function getUniqueStrings(arr) {
  // create an empty object to store unique strings
  let uniqueStrings = {};

  // iterate through the array
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // add each string as a key in the object
    uniqueStrings[arr[i]] = true;
  }

  // get the keys of the object and return them as an array
  return Object.keys(uniqueStrings);
}

getUniqueStrings(jobs.flatMap(k => k.skills))
```
